### 🏦 Bank Marketing Term Deposit Prediction

This project is a classification analysis to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on their personal and financial data.

## 📊 Dataset

  - **Source**: [UCI Bank Marketing Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/bank+marketing)
  - **Records**: 45,211
  - **Target**: `y` (1 = subscribed, 0 = not subscribed)

## 🔧 Key Steps

  - Dropped the 'duration' column, as it can lead to unrealistic model performance.
  - Visualized key data distributions and relationships.
  - Split the data into a 70% training set and a 30% testing set.
  - Trained a classification model.
